# Library Management API

The Library Management API facilitates the management of a library system where users (members) can view, borrow, and
return books, while administrators can manage the collection of books. The system uses JWT authentication and role-based
access control to ensure secure access.

### Setup
1. `git clone git@github.com:lzytourist/library.git`
2. `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate `
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python manage.py runserver`
